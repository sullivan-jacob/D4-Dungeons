Shal'Hatir, an Aasimar bard with a flair for the dramatic. A half-angel with an F in religion, outcast from other Aasimar for being too worldly and hedonistic and not pure and angelic enough. Low in intelligence, high in wisdom, and soaring with charisma, he's a lover of life without living life as a lover; which is to say, he's a rare celibate bard. He bards out of love for music, stories, and adventure. He has no overarching goal in life, and prefers to wander around seeking adventure where he can find it just for the sake of having an adventure and living life to the fullest.

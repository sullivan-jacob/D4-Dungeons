Deckard Roll, son of Rick Roll. Tiefling Bard. A follower of Garl Glittergold, trickster god to the gnomes that has sought adventure to gain his favor.
Deckard was inspired by the legends of folk heroes, but also shadowed by two legends: His father, a famous and successful Bard, and his people, thought to be descended from Asmodeus, King of the Nine Hells. He began his adventures as a way to build his own legend and come out of the shadows of the legends of others.

To him, virtue is tied to how famous you are.
A story worthy enough for a song.

            <h1>Website Development</h1>
            <p>This page is meant to help players know what features are under Development and what bugs are being addressed.<br>
            Features will be listed here along with their current progress. Completed features will be listed on this page for two weeks after completion.<br>
            Known bugs will be listed here, as well as a description of them and how close they are to being removed. Bugs can be sent to Sullie over discord in the bugs channel.</p>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h3>Theme Selection Memory</h3>
            <p>The goal of the Theme Selection Memory feature is to maintain the selected theme between pages and sessions, instead of turning dark mode on everytime a page is loaded.<br>
            The plan for how to achieve this has been established; however, initial test have achieved unexpected results. The current plan is to meet with a Web Development professor to fix the issues.</p>
            <h3>New Theme UI</h3>
            <p>The goal with this feature is to allow for more themes than light and dark mode.<br>
            Theme suggestions are needed. Suggestions should have the HEX code of the colors and a description of where each color is used.<br>
            A new Theme UI is needed inorder to support more themes. This feature will be worked on once the Theme Selection Memory feature has been completed.</p>
            <h3>Integrated Digital Character Sheet with DM access to current character sheet</h3>
            <p>The goal of this feature is to give players a digital character sheet that saves data between sessions, as well as provide the DM access to each player's character sheet. List of included features: Full character sheet; spell list, spell slot, Ki point, bardic inspiration, rage uses, conscentration, and condition tracking; spell and feature descriptions;<br>
            This is still in concpet and I have to learn some things in order to impliment this, but it is high on the to-do list.</p>
            <h2>Bugs</h2>
            <h3>Text boxes on some webpages merges with the navagation bar when viewing from mobile device</h3>
            <P>When viewing the website on a mobile device, some text boxes merge with the navigation bar. While the text never overlaps and this doesn't effect functionality, this is not the intended behavior and looks weird.<br>
            I have been unsuccessful in correcting this, and will be working with a Web Development professor to correct it.</P>
            <h3>Page Title on some webpages displays improperly when it's space is taken up by the navigation bar on mobile devices</h3>
            <p>This is a seporate manifestation of the same bug as above. This will be handled differently from the above bug report, but will be handled at the same time.</p>

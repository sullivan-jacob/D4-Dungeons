            <h1>To Give My Name</h1>
            <h2>By Everett Whitaker</h2>
            <p>
                Verity Thistlewater had been an honored guest of the Archfey Titania for many months. Or at least, Verity thought it had been many months. She was well aware that attempting to impress her mortal conceptions of the passage of time onto a place like the Feywild was basically useless here. Time moved how the Feywild thought it should move, and it often changed its mind. It also was not entirely true that Verity was merely an honored guest of Lady Titania. Choosing to court a mortal was not wholly unusual for Titania, but it had been some time by the reckoning of the fey, since she had last taken a mortal lover. Everyone in Titania’s court knew it wouldn’t last forever. The life of Verity Thistlewater was but a mere comma in the eternal story of the fey. But damn it to the Courts of Hell if Verity wasn’t going to make the most of the time she had.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun had begun to rise, peeking through the westward window, casting its beautiful rays across the personal chambers of Lady Titania of the Seelie Court. Verity blinked, flailing her arms about in an attempt to protect the sanctity of her last moments of blissful repose from the light of morning. Titania turned to regard Verity, her hair all the beautiful colors of a forest in autumn, her burnished skin glowing even more in the morning sunlight. “In your culture is it commonly believed that the flailing of one’s arms could stop the advance of morning?” Titania asked playfully, smiling with both her mouth and her beautiful golden eyes. Verity threw her arms into the air in mock frustration before turning to regard Titania, she sulked only for a moment before she could hold her laughter in no more, and the two shared a deep kiss. Titania pulled away, cupping Verity’s face with a gentle, yet still regal, hand. “Good morning my love, my dear, sweet, Lyra.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Verity couldn’t help but cringe at the sound of her false name being spoken so tenderly by the woman she loved. The Circle did not worship the fey, but they were respected enough by most to know that to give one’s true name to a fey was potentially just as dangerous as signing one’s soul to a fiend. Yet, this woman was the love of Verity’s life, and yet, the simplest of truths were kept from each other. Gazing into her love’s radiant and loving eyes, Verity began to weep and turned away, sitting up, gazing into the sunlight that mere minutes ago she wished would get out of her eyes. “Lyra?” Titania asked, as she got out of the wide bed and came to rest a hand on Verity’s shoulder. “What’s wrong, honey?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Verity looked up at the most beautiful creature she had ever beheld. A woman with a dominion and station beyond anything her fellow druids could even comprehend. A woman that, despite the vast differences between the two, had still chosen to love Verity Thistlewater. “Lyra,” Verity whispered through her quiet tears, “it’s not my real name. Saying it so tenderly to me is a constant reminder that I cannot be as close to you as I wish.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Titania nodded, and removed her hand from Verity’s shoulder. She stepped back, offering the same hand to Verity to help her up. “There is a rite, seldom taken between fey lovers” Titania explained as Verity stood hand in hand and face to face with her love. “A rite even more seldom than marriage, but even older than it.” Titania again brought her hand to Verity’s cheek, and brought it up, brushing the tears away from her eyes. “The exchange of true names. It is one of the deepest commitments a fey can show to a lover. For it gives your partner great power over you, and a great trust that they will not misuse it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Standing there, surrounded by the golden light of the sun, Verity knew what she had to do. “I will give you my name, my love, if you will give me yours.” Titania laughed joyously, “Of course, love.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Titania held Verity’s hands tightly with her own, and began to speak. A practiced oath, but one not devoid of true emotion, despite its rigidity. “Throughout the lands of fey and men, I am known as Titania. The Lady of Summer, and the Lady of Light. But to you I give my truest name. The name of power. A name which I give willingly to you: Lairëalcar.” Titania nodded to Verity, who smiled deeply as she began to speak. “Throughout the lands of fey and men, I am known as Lyra, the druid, and the feylost. But to you I give my truest name. The name of power. A name which I give willingly to you: Verity Thistlewater.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Verity felt a warmth of magic unlike any she had ever felt rush through Titania’s palms into her own, flowing through the rest of her body like a river following its bed after the bursting of a dam. The light of the sun seemed brighter, and Titania even fairer than she had been. “Let it be witnessed,” Titania spoke softly, as she pressed her forehead to Verity’s, “By the summer’s sun, the wild winds, and the surest streams: our names exchanged, I am yours, and you are mine.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Verity brought her hands to Titania’s face, pulling her in for a kiss. A kiss which tasted of honey and flowers, and of thistles and clear spring water. It was sweeter than any kiss that had before been shared between the two, and Verity was content to let that moment last for as long as she could. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So she did. And for once, the feywild’s whimsy regarding the passage of time seemed content to play in Verity’s favor. Because she could have sworn that moment lasted an eternity.
